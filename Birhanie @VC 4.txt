Popular Version Control Systems:

* Git: The most widely used distributed version control system. It's incredibly powerful, flexible, and has a vast community and abundant resources. GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are popular platforms that host Git repositories.
* Subversion (SVN): A centralized version control system. It's simpler than Git but less flexible for complex workflows.
* Mercurial: Another distributed version control system, similar to Git in functionality but with a different approach.
