i got screwed up as usual.lol




guys my status was locked through the process.. but its fixed.. if any one on my situation this was the solution

#!/bin/bash
LOCK_FILE=".git/index.lock"

if [ -f "$LOCK_FILE" ]; then
    echo "⚠️ Lock file found: $LOCK_FILE"
    echo "Removing it now..."
    rm -f "$LOCK_FILE"
    echo "✅ Lock file removed. You can now run Git commands."
else
    echo "✅ No lock file found. You're good to go!"
fi
