Benefits of Using Version Control:

* Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's changes.
* History Tracking: You can see who made which changes, when they were made, and why. This is invaluable for debugging and understanding the project's evolution.
* Rollback: Easily revert to previous versions if a change introduces errors or unexpected behavior.
* Experimentation: Branches allow you to experiment with new features without risking the stability of the main codebase.
* Backup: Your project's history is safely stored, acting as a reliable backup.
* Code Review: Facilitates code review processes, allowing others to inspect and provide feedback on changes before they are merged into the main branch.
