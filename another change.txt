creating remote repository - on GitHub
download or clone remote repo to local machine - using git clone command

we follow three stage work flow:
1. making a change on the local repo -- modification - by creating a new file , by modifying -update existing file, by delete existing files
2. track the change  -- staging or indexing
3. saving the tracked change to local repo - committing
4. pushing or notifying the change we made to the local repo to remote repo -- using push command


Tracking the change using three stage workflow

1, modifiy ---> making a change
2, staging ---> tracking the change/the modification using --> git add .
3, commit to local repository ---> git commit -m "the message"
4, pushing to remote repository
