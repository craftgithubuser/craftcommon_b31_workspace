Difference between a++ and ++a
Both are increment operators that increase a by 1.

âœ… a++ â†’ Post-Increment
Increments a by 1, but returns the original value before incrementing.

âœ… ++a â†’ Pre-Increment
Increments a by 1, and returns the new incremented value.

ðŸŒŸ Example for clarity:
java
Copy
Edit
int a = 5;
int b;

b = a++;   // post-increment
âœ… What happens:

b gets the current value of a (5).

Then a is incremented to 6.

âœ… Result:

a = 6

b = 5

java
Copy
Edit
int a = 5;
int b;

b = ++a;   // pre-increment
âœ… What happens:

a is first incremented to 6.

Then b gets the new value of a (6).

âœ… Result:

a = 6

b = 6

âœ… Quick Summary Table:
Operator	Meaning	Returns	When increment happens
a++	Post-increment	Old value	After the value is used
++a	Pre-increment	New value	Before the value is used

ðŸŒŸ Usage in Expressions:
Example:
java
Copy
Edit
int a = 5;
System.out.println(a++);   // prints 5, then a becomes 6
System.out.println(++a);   // a becomes 7, then prints 7
âœ… Key Takeaway:

Use ++a when you need the incremented value immediately.

Use a++ when you need the original value before incrementing.
